## Knowledge

Google Voice is a great free voice over IP tool. It has the following nice features.

1. set up your own voice prompt
2. voice to text transcription for free for english at least, or maybe only for your home language

Back in the days (2022 and earlier), you can mark all missed calls and missed messages as read, which is a typical feature or user experience for email, message like tool. Around 2022 February, Google stopped supporting the legacy platform and disabled the "Mark All as Read" feature on the web UI. Users will have to go to the mobile app to do that.

If you search by Google, you could only see [this article][1] now which announced an end without any reasoning or apology to legacy users.

If you search "mark all as read google voice" now, there are no official guides from Google on how to do that. It is kind of disappointing that only community answers ([the best solution][2], [what happened][2]) are available.

It prompts me to think about two things.

1. Google fails to monetize "Google Voice" and existing users were hit, although it is a great product. Maybe a healthier customer engagement will help.
2. As generations change, sometimes quality is sacrificed for other considerations. It is probably not that hard to continue supporting an existing feature or introduce backwards compatible changes, but Google chose to drop it. Maybe Google can be creative and keep the support without too much expense. Google Voice still has the business plans.

So now in 2024, you can only use the mobile app (Android or iOS) to mark all as read for Google Voice.
