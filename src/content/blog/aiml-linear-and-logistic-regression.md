## Glossary

1. Feature: inputs to the model; the `x` variables in the math equation.
2. Label: the output of the model; what we are trying to predict; they `y` variable in the math equation.

## Linear Regression

![straight line](https://developers.google.com/static/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression/images/car-data-points-with-model.png)

In linear regression, we are trying to fit the model with a linear math equation.
In the simplest form, we can visualize the model with a straight line in the figure above.

The math equation is $y = mx + b$ or $y = b + w_1 \cdot x_1$.

The slope `m` or `w` of the line is the weight for the features of the model. The intercept `b` is the bias of the model.
